# Embetter Discord Bot - Privacy Policy

## Introduction
Welcome to the Privacy Policy for the Embetter Discord Bot. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring you have a secure experience while using our bot. This policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and what controls you have over your data.

## Data We Collect
The only data we collect is the identification information for your Discord server, commonly known as the guild ID. This guild ID is essential for customizing and operating Embetter within your specific Discord server.

## No Message Storage
Rest assured, we do not store any of your messages. Our bot is designed to interact with you in real-time and does not maintain any historical records of your text or voice conversations.

## How We Use Data
The guild ID we collect is used exclusively for configuring Embetter to function as designed within your Discord server. This includes custom settings, features, and functionalities that you may enable or disable.

## Data Sharing
We do not share your guild ID or any other data with third parties. The only exceptions would be in compliance with legal requirements or if you explicitly authorize us to do so.

## Security
While it is true that no method of data storage is completely secure, we take robust security measures to protect the data we do collect. This includes encryption and secure access controls.

## Data Deletion
To get your data deleted, you can either remove the bot from your server, or contact us directly. Upon receiving your request, we will promptly delete the guild ID and any associated settings from our database.

## Contact Information
For any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact us through our Discord server [here](https://discord.gg/2mhXfRNHak) or via email at everett@southwick.dev.
